# Java-Servlet-Web-Application
Here is a small Java Web Application, that I have continued building using JSPs and servlets, with a PostgreSQL database. I created several Java classes and files, including a StudentDA class with an authenticate() method, and modified the Student class to have a similar authenticate() method that calls the StudentDA method. Additionally, I created a website with header and footer JSP files, and implemented an index, login, dashboard, register, and update JSP page that uses the header and footer files. I made sure that the website had a dynamic page title and navigation bar that changes depending on whether a Student object has been loaded in the session or not. Finally, I ensured that my HTML conforms to XHTML 1.0 Strict compliance.
